My reasearch takes a differential approach (dominance, differential dissipativity) for analysis and control designs of nonlinear systems with non-equilibrium behaviours, i.e. multistablty, oscillations. 
I am also interested in the interdisciplinary resarch across control engineering, robotics and system biology, as well as control applications to real-world problems.
